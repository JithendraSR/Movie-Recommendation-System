Apriori Algorithm

   Association rules mining is the main task of data mining. It consists of two
compulsory steps, the first step is discovery of frequent itemsets, and the second one
is extracting the rules from the mined frequent itemsets.The first step is a massive
computational step. There are many algorithms presented to complete this step, but all of
these algorithms are variations of the Apriori Algorithm, which is the state of the art.
Apriori Requires a priori knowledge to generate the frequent itemsets and involves two
time-consuming pruning steps to exclude the infrequent candidates and hold frequents. The
first pruning operation is degenerating each of the (k+1)-itemsets to its k-itemset subsets.

    The second pruning operation is to support counting for each candidate passed the first exam.
In this project, we applied a data mining algorithm, Apriori, to mine a relationship
among films and build a movie recommendation engine. We used this technique to discover
items that are frequently watched together. Frequently watched movies itemset suggests
marketing opportunity when customers displayed interest in the subset items.
